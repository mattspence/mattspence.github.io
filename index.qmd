Hello! My name is Matt Spence, and I am a senior advisor at the [US Census Bureau][USCB] working on special population statistics and disclosure avoidance. <!-- I have copied my recent talks and publications here-->

From 2016 -- 2021, I was the chief of the [Foreign Born Population Branch][FBPB], which collects and publishes data on people born outside the United States.

Before that, I was the program lead for the [Education Demographic, Geographic, and Economic Statistics (EDGE)][EDGE] program, which provides demographic, social, and economic characteristics on schoolchildren and their parents, and I was the director of the [CCD Non-Fiscal Survey][CCD], which gathers information on all schools and school districts in the U.S. I've also worked in the Governments Division of the Census Bureau. 

Before I joined the Census Bureau, I was a Ph.D. candidate in [political science at UCLA][PS UCLA]. My dissertation research was on distributive politics: specifically, on the incidence and patterns of political manipulation of local public goods in India. 

<!--My resume is [here][resume]. -->You can email me [here](mailto:matt@mattspence.com).

My wife, daughters, and I currently live in the DC metro area, and we're doing our best to explore it. Let me know if we should check somewhere out!
